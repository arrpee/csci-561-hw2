# CSCI 561 HW2: Game Playing

This repository contains the code for a programming assignment involving minimax and alpha-beta pruning to play the game of 5x5 Go (modified ruleset).

A description of the game and the assignment can be found in the [homework description](./CS561-HW2.pdf).


## Usage

The AI agent can be run against the random player through the following commands:
```bash
\test.ps1
```

## Results

The player was tested against different agents that were created by the course producers. A description of each agent can be found in the homework description. The AI agent beat the random, greedy and aggresive player with over a 90% winrate, the alpha-beta player with a 80% winrate, and the championship player with a 60% winrate.
